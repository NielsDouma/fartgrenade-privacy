Privacy Policy for Motion Scare
Effective Date: February 21, 2026

Niels Douma ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Motion Scare mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

1. Information Collection and Use
To provide the core functionality of the tripwire prank, our app requires access to certain features on your device. We do not collect or store any personal information on external servers.

Camera: We use the camera to detect motion for the "tripwire" trigger and to record the video of the prank. All processing happens locally on your device. * Microfoon (Audio): Used only if you choose to record custom sounds for the premium version or for audio in recorded prank videos.

Storage: The app saves recorded videos directly to your device's gallery or internal storage. We do not have access to these files once they are saved.

2. Data Security
The security of your data is important to us. Remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. However, since Motion Scare does not upload your videos or recordings to the cloud, your data remains under your own control on your physical device.

3. Permissions Detail
CAMERA: Required for motion detection.

RECORD_AUDIO: Required for custom sound recordings.

READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Required to save and view your prank videos.

4. Children's Privacy
Our Service is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

5. Third-Party Services
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use personalized data (like your Advertising ID) to show relevant ads. Please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy for more details.

6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us via our GitHub profile or developer contact in the Play Store.
